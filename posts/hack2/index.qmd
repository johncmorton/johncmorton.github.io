Grassroots campaigns, donation drives, and voter canvassing always start with a voter list. Obtaining these lists is often difficult, and large corporations often monopolize the voter records and sell them to other organizations. We’ve organized the Ohio voting history for 8 million voters across 20 years and combined geographical information with census data, to help political groups find potential voters.

We used a variety of tools to accomplish this, including:
